# Lazerbeak12345's Minimal Shell

A shell that seeks to only provide the bare minimum of utilities needed to be `/bin/sh` compatible, written in rust, with a goal of WASM+WASI compatibility. It's made for a specific project that I haven't yet made public.

## Name

LMSH stands for **L**azerbeak12345's **M**inimal **Sh**ell.

In some cases I've use Micro instead of Minimal. Those cases were typos.
