# Lazerbeak's Minimal SHell

A shell that seeks to only provide the bare minimum of utilities needed to be `/bin/sh` compatible, written in rust, with a goal of WASM+WASI compatibility. It's made for a specific project that I haven't yet made public.

## Licencing, and terms of use

I haven't yet decided what licence to put this software under. If you would like to request compatibility with a licence you are using, please make an issue on GitHub and I will likely change to a well-known BSD, MIT or GPL licence that fits your needs. **Please do this if you've used this software**; I'm unsure of what use-cases this software might have, that and I'm unsure of how _I_ plan on using it.

Once I do pick a licence, you may optionally choose to use that licence for this version of the software
